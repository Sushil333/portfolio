import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I'm a final year student and, pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Engineering.

I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open-source, and the web platform ❤️.

Aside from my academics, I like to Design & Build Modern, Responsive, Pixel Perfect UI. In my spare time I contribute to open-source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things ✍️ at my <a href="https://sbrocks.medium.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>blog</Underlining></a>.
